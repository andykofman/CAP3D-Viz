## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- **Initial release** of CAP3D-Viz as a professional Python package
- **State-machine parser** with 70-80% reduction in condition checking
- **Memory-efficient streaming** for large CAP3D files (10k+ blocks)
- **Interactive 3D visualization** with Plotly integration
- **Batched rendering** for smooth visualization of 50k+ blocks
- **Level of Detail (LOD)** system for intelligent block prioritization
- **Professional IC design features** with industry-standard colors
- **Comprehensive CAP3D format support**:
  - Blocks (rectangular 3D volumes)
  - Polygonal elements with custom coordinates
  - Layer definitions (interconnect, via, metal, poly, contact)
  - Window boundaries for simulation context
  - Task definitions for capacitance calculations
- **High-performance capabilities**:
  - Parse speed: 9,882+ blocks/second
  - Memory usage: <8MB for 10k blocks
  - Interactive filtering: <500ms latency
- **Modular architecture** with separate components:
  - `data_models.py`: Core data structures
  - `parser.py`: State-machine parsing logic
  - `visualizer.py`: 3D visualization engine
  - `utils.py`: Convenience functions
- **Comprehensive documentation**:
  - Installation guide
  - Performance optimization guide
  - API reference
  - Usage examples
- **Professional packaging**:
  - PyPI distribution support
  - Modern pyproject.toml configuration
  - Comprehensive test suite
  - Development tools integration (black, flake8, mypy)

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Parse Time**: 1.01s Â± 0.15s for 10k blocks
- **Memory Usage**: 7.25MB peak for 10k blocks
- **Visualization**: First frame in 14.9-20.8s for 10k blocks
- **Filtering**: 458ms for conductors, 463ms for mediums
- **Throughput**: 3-4 MB/s file processing

### Technical Improvements
- **Dispatch tables** for direct function mapping
- **Context-aware parsing** - only relevant conditions checked
- **Pre-compiled patterns** for common operations
- **Reduced string operations** - minimized overhead
- **Vectorized vertex generation** using NumPy
- **Cached mesh data** for instant re-rendering
- **Optimized trace grouping** for better performance

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- Command-line interface (CLI) for batch processing
- Export to common 3D formats (STL, OBJ, PLY)
- Advanced lighting and shading options
- Multi-threaded parsing for even better performance
- Plugin architecture for custom visualizations
- Integration with popular EDA tools
- Real-time collaboration features
