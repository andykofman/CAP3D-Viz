# Enhancements Timeline

This file outlines major improvements documented in the README files across releases.

## Version 1.0.0 (Commit `5b19d53`)
- Introduced `cap3d_enhanced.py` and the accompanying `cap3d_enhanced_README.md`.
- Added benchmark tests and a more detailed project structure.

## Version 1.1.0 (Commit `2791b53`)
- Added the **Enhanced Cache Memory** system with approximately 2.5Ã— performance gain.
- `cap3d_enhanced_README.md` expanded with technical documentation and benchmarks for 10k block datasets.

## Further Optimizations (Commits `1597eda` and `9e3c8a2`)
- Finalized the optimized parser in `ehnanced_Cache_memory.py`.
- README highlights state-machine parsing, dispatch tables, and batched rendering.
- Tests demonstrate production readiness on large files.

## Modular Refactoring (Latest)
- **Refactored** `ehnanced_Cache_memory.py` into modular components in `enhanced_cache_memory/`.
- **Separated concerns** into data models, parser, visualizer, and utilities.
- **Maintained backward compatibility** with original file.
- **Improved scalability** for future development and maintenance.
- **Enhanced documentation** with component-specific README files.

These enhancements transformed the tool from a basic visualizer into a high-performance solution capable of handling industrial-scale CAP3D files with a scalable modular architecture.
