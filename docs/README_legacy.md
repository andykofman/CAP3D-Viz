# Legacy Versions of cap3d_view

This document summarizes the earliest iterations of the project based on the commit history of `README.md` and `src/cap3d_enhanced_README.md`.

## 1. Initial Visualization Tool
- **Commit [`a1e0fa6`](https://github.com)** – Added `cap3d_view.py` and a comprehensive README introducing a Python tool to parse and visualize CAP3D files.
- Provided basic matplotlib 3D plotting for mediums and conductors.

## 2. Block Construction Animation
- **Commit [`cbc077c`](https://github.com)** – Updated README to showcase block construction using `block_animation.py`.

## 3. Interactive Plotly Version
- **Commit [`30c5d66`](https://github.com)** – Introduced a Plotly-based interactive version, offering rotation, zoom, and multiple view modes.
- README described improved user interaction and dashboard-style controls.

## 4. Project Restructure
- **Commit [`f94c228`](https://github.com)** – Restructured repository layout for scalability.
- README revisions highlighted separation between legacy matplotlib script and the new interactive version.

## 5. Miscellaneous Updates
- Subsequent commits (`f0559f9`, `0942fa7`, `0bbcb74`) refined wording and screenshots.
- Image updates and merge conflict resolutions were handled in commits `5d5fe9c` and `d0a9e3c`.

The legacy implementation relied on matplotlib for static plots and an early Plotly script for interactivity. These versions served as the foundation for later optimization work.
