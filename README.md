# cap3d_view

A Python tool for visualizing 3D geometry and block construction from CAP3D files generated by the RWCap tool (for calculating capacitances of 3-D structures). This project provides both interactive 3D visualization and static plotting, with an animation of block construction to help understand the geometry described in .cap3d files.

### 🆕 Enhanced Version (cap3d_enhanced.py) (Under Development)
- Optimized for large CAP3D files and advanced workflows
- Inspired by `LEVEL OF DETAIL` from TU Delft. Although the proposed idea in the ([article](https://osmbuildings.org/blog/2018-02-28_level_of_detail/)) is for buildings. However, the same approach can be applied to visualizing integrated circuits
- See `src/cap3d_enhanced_README.md` for details and usage

## Interactive Version (Recommended)

The **new Plotly version** (`cap3d_plotly.py`) provides a modern, interactive 3D visualization experience with enhanced features:

### Features
- **Interactive 3D visualization** with mouse controls (rotate, zoom, pan)
- **Component toggling** - Show/hide mediums and conductors independently
- **Enhanced hover information** - Detailed component data on mouse-over
- **Multiple view modes** - Complete, mediums-only, conductors-only, and z-sliced views
- **Professional styling** - Better colors, transparency, and layout
- **Dashboard interface** - Menu-driven visualization options
- **Automatic statistics** - Component counts and dimensional analysis

### Requirements for Interactive Version
```bash
pip install numpy plotly matplotlib
```

### Usage (Interactive Version)
```bash
python cap3d_plotly.py
```

The script will:
1. Display a visualization dashboard menu with file statistics
2. Show multiple interactive 3D plots in your browser
3. Provide different view modes for comprehensive analysis

## Block Construction Animation
The animation below (generated by `src/block_animation.py`) shows how each block is built step by step from its basepoint and vectors:

## 📊 Visualization Comparison

| Feature | Interactive (Plotly) | Legacy (Matplotlib) |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 3D Controls | ✅ Mouse rotate/zoom/pan | ⚠️ Limited matplotlib controls |
| Hover Info | ✅ Rich component details | ❌ None |
| Component Toggle | ✅ Show/hide by type | ❌ Static view |
| Multiple Views | ✅ Dashboard with options | ❌ Single view |
| Web Browser | ✅ Opens in browser | ❌ Desktop window |
| Performance | ✅ Smooth interaction | ⚠️ Static rendering |

## Legacy Version (Matplotlib)

The original version (`cap3d_matplotlib.py`) provides static 3D visualization using matplotlib:

### Legacy Features
- Parses CAP3D files containing definitions for mediums and conductors in 3D space
- Static 3D visualization using matplotlib
- Supports z-slice visualization
- Color-coded conductors and mediums

### Legacy Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Legacy Usage
```bash
python src/cap3d_matplotlib.py
```

## CAP3D File Format

A CAP3D file contains sections for mediums, conductors, and a window. Each medium or conductor can have one or more blocks, each defined by:

- `basepoint(x, y, z)`: The starting corner of the block.
- `v1(dx, dy, dz)`: Vector defining one edge from the basepoint.
- `v2(dx, dy, dz)`: Vector defining another edge from the basepoint.
- `hvector(dx, dy, dz)`: Vector for the block's height/thickness.

Example block:

```
<block>
    name block1
    basepoint(-2, -2, 0)
    v1(4, 0, 0)
    v2(0, 4, 0)
    hvector(0, 0, 0.3)
</block>
```

## How it works

- The script parses the CAP3D file, extracting all mediums and conductors and their blocks
- Each block is converted into a 3D box using its basepoint and vectors
- Boxes are rendered in 3D with mediums shown as transparent and conductors as opaque
- **Interactive version**: Provides multiple view modes and interactive controls
- **Legacy version**: Shows static plots with optional z-slice visualization

## Customization

### Interactive Version
- Modify the `cap3d_file` variable in `cap3d_plotly.py`
- Use the dashboard menu to select different visualization modes
- Interactive controls allow real-time exploration

### Legacy Version
- Change the `cap3d_file` variable in `cap3d_matplotlib.py`
- Modify the `z_slice` parameter in the `draw_components` function call
